title: TaaS: Innovations in the Blockchain Industry
---

 Utilizing the Ethereum blockchain and its Cryptographic Audit technology, TaaS was co-founded by Blockchain protagonists Konstantin Pysarenko, Ruslan Gavrilyuk, Dmytro Chupryna and Maksym Muratov. Together with team members from the United States, China, Poland, South Africa and the Ukraine, fledgling startup TaaS with offices in Kiev and San Francisco intends to offer a "New way" to participate in and benefit from capital raising, fund management and cryptocurrency investing. 

 As the first and truly transparent closed-end fund on the market, Pysarenko stated that TaaS offers a solution to all the above cited problems. Unlike traditional closed-end funds, TaaS will issue tokens, which represent a 'Proof-of-Membership' in a fund that are built on a profit-sharing smart contract - executed by an Ethereum smart contract - where token owners collect 50% of quarterly profits. 

 TaaS tokens will have their value "Explicitly tied" to the performance of its parent project, thereby introducing a 'Token-as-a-Service' business model. In addition to their fund, TaaS is also building Kepler, which is described as a "First Bloomberg-like" cryptocurrency portfolio management and analytics platform that aims to cover the "Entire spectrum" of the investment process. 

 Pysarenko boldly posited: "The overall aim of TaaS is to deliver long-lasting innovations in the blockchain industry. And, we believe that TaaS and Kepler are on track to revolutionize the journey of investing in cryptocurrencies and tokens forever and we are excited to watch it all unfold."
