title: Reading Vs Audiobooks

I stumbled upon an [article](https://curiosity.com/topics/whether-you-read-or-listen-your-brain-processes-books-the-same-way-curiosity/#reading-can-change-your-brain-dnews) recently, which describes how your brain processes similar information regardless of whether you're reading or listening.  This was interesting to me because I always thought reading helped enhance your comprehension and language skills, but if listening can do the same, I'm definitely open to it.

I downloaded Audible to try their first month free and cashed in my credit for The Golden Compass.  I'm already onto chapter 3 and so far, it's been great.  I'm imagining the story as though I'm reading it, and I'm able to take long walks and "read" at the same time.  Up until now I've always occupied my commute time between places with Podcasts, however, I'm enjoying listening to books a lot!
