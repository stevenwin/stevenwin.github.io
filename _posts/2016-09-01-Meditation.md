*DRAFT*

I was recently introduced to the book **Meditation in Plain English**, and having read the first chapter, it's given me a boost in attempting a meditation habit.  I'm only on day 3, yet I feel refreshed after each section (maybe cause I'm sleeping a bit in between them..?).

Meditation is a strange thing.  I've heard of the benefits from articles of how and real physical change it can have on your brain, but the act feels as though you're not doing much at all.  All that's required so far is for me to sit in a quiet place, close my eyes, and just focus on my breath and bring stillness to my mind for as long as I can bare it.  I'm onto ten minutes, but in that stillness, it feels like an eternity.  It's a difficult discipline to master, but I do feel like I'm reaping some of the rewards already.

An interesting passage from the book states:

> There you are, and you suddenly realize that you are spending your whole life just barely getting by. You keep up a good front. You manage to make ends meet somehow and look okay from the outside. But those periods of desperation, those times when you feel everything caving in on you—you keep those to yourself. You are a mess, and you know it. But you hide it beautifully. Meanwhile, way down under all of that, you just know that there has to be some other way to live, a better way to look at the world, a way to touch life more fully. You click into it by chance now and then: you get a good job. You fall in love. You win the game. For a while, things are different. Life takes on a richness and clarity that makes all the bad times and humdrum fade away. The whole texture of your experience changes and you say to yourself, “Okay, now I’ve made it; now I will be happy.” But then that fades too, like smoke in the wind. You are left with just a memory.

It reminds me of an Alan Watts' lectures, or Bill Hicks' "It's just a ride" bit.  We all get caught up in the illusion that happiness is something that can be obtained and kept.  In reality, it is fleeting.  Happiness has an arbitrary meaning
