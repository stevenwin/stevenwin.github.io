*DRAFT*

I was recently introduced to the book **Mindfulness in Plain English**, which has given me a boost in attempting a meditation habit.  I'm only on day 3, yet I feel refreshed after each session (maybe cause I'm sleeping a bit in between them..?).

Meditation is a strange thing.  I've heard of benefits from friends and have read articles on how real positive change can happen in the brain, however, the act of meditating still feels as though you're not doing much at all.  But that's the point.  Meditation is supposed to calm the brain and allow yourself to just be an observer of your thoughts and feelings.  It's a difficult discipline to master because sitting in silence for even a moment is not something many of us are used to.  If it weren't for this book, and particularly this passage below, I'd probably have given up after the first day due to boredom:

> There you are, and you suddenly realize that you are spending your whole life just barely getting by. You keep up a good front. You manage to make ends meet somehow and look okay from the outside. But those periods of desperation, those times when you feel everything caving in on you—you keep those to yourself. You are a mess, and you know it. But you hide it beautifully. Meanwhile, way down under all of that, you just know that there has to be some other way to live, a better way to look at the world, a way to touch life more fully. You click into it by chance now and then: you get a good job. You fall in love. You win the game. For a while, things are different. Life takes on a richness and clarity that makes all the bad times and humdrum fade away. The whole texture of your experience changes and you say to yourself, “Okay, now I’ve made it; now I will be happy.” But then that fades too, like smoke in the wind. You are left with just a memory.

It reminds me of this [Alan Watts lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM1Wk4AfBGM) or this [Bill Hick bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzQuE1pR1w).  We all get caught up in the illusion that happiness is a static point which can be achieved by an end goal -- a girlfriend, a raise, a vacation and so on.  We strive so hard to achieve it and in the end, when we finally do, we're elated for a moment but then we eventually come back to baseline.  Life, happiness and everything is about the journey.  Meditation helps us rewire our mind to understand this.
