This past weekend was met with wonderment and bliss down at Harrison Hot Springs.  My girlfriend and I made an impromptu camping trip 20 minutes past the resort at Hicks Lake.  The camping was great but the time spent the day after at Harrison is one of my favourite events ever -- and it almost didn't happen.

The day after our camping stay at Hicks lake we woke up tired from a semi-restless night.  I didn't feel like we'd have enough time to spend at Harrison because I needed to trek the 2.5 hours back home and start preparing for my work week ahead.  After a bit of time cleaning up and enjoying the scenery at Hicks I changed my mind and decided we should at least walk around Harrison since we're already up here.  Impulsively, my girlfriend suggested we ingest some Teachers and wander the beach.  Fantastic idea.

As we pulled up to the parking lot, the nausea from the veggie was starting to kick in.  I started to doubt the the decision and felt like I was going to be sick for the remainder of the day.  We pulled out our lawn chairs and meandered across the beach towards a single bench overlooking a serene landscape.  The moments after were filled with bliss, introspection and relief.  It was one of the best days of my life.
