title: Tadpoles and Bowser at Harrison
---

As we pulled up to the parking lot, the nausea settled in.  Mindful of the experience to come, we meandered across the beach towards a single bench overlooking a serene landscape.  I knew this would be our base and I let my companion loose to enjoy her rocks and aqua Nirvana.  Sitting perfectly between shadow and light, the heat from the sun balanced itself with the soothing breeze.

In our mind's eye, this was our little secret.  The tadpoles gleamed iridescently across the waves and the clouds slowly dispersed into a hundred tiny Bowsers.  Not a single thought that arose were of troubles.  Misery did not thrive in this timeless spot.  I closed my eyes and let bliss envelop my being.
