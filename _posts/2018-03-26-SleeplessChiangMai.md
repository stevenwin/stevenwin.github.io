title: Sleepless in Chiang Mai

When I told people I was going to be traveling for the better part of six months, everyone responded with how envious they were of my good fortune.  It's true that it's unusual to be able to get away like this, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity, but solo traveling is not always glorious.  Don't get me wrong, the majority of my trip thus far has been surreal, and the experiences I've encountered will bring me stories and memories to last a lifetime, but sometimes the loneliness really eats into your psyche.

It's late in the night and I can't sleep.  Lucky for me I'm staying at a nice AirBnB and it has Netflix.  And with all the choices, I'm turning to one of my favourite movies to get me through this bittersweet moment -- Sleepless in Seattle :)

Yep, Sleepless in Seattle is one of my favourites and after 25 years, I think it still holds up.  Why?  I'm watching it now and I think perhaps it's the genuine emotions that are conveyed by the actors.  Everyone from Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, to the kids, Rosie O'Donnell, Bill Pullman -- basically the entire cast regardless of how little they actually spoke in the movie all added a lot to the overall feel.  There were laugh out loud moments and many others that pull at your heartstrings.  However, perhaps the most important part is the fairy tale ending of the classic Empire State Building scene that really cements into my memory.

Ah who I am kidding, watching it as a kid, Meg Ryan was a damn goddess so that was probably the major reason actually.
