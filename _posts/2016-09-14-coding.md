Programming feels like a necessary skill in the 21st century.  More and more, all of our daily menial tasks are being converted into their digital counterparts and it’s driving away the need for human intervention.  It doesn’t matter if this skill is applied in your professional life, knowing even the basics seem to help with everyday problem solving.
