title: Once Bitten, Twice Shy
---

It doesn't matter how long you've known somebody, you're only ever seeing what they want to show.  The illusion of comfort, trust and understanding of your counterpart is only true on sunny days.  When the rain comes and the night is cold and long, keeping oneself warm at the expense of another's is the only real guarantee.  

Once bitten, twice shy -- an old adage about learning from our mistakes.  I feel this is an area of contention because you're only twice shy in areas that are absolute.  If you raid a bee's nest and you're stung, the next time you do it, you will be stung.  It's less true for relationships because of the complexities in them.  Once bitten in a relationship, whether it's romantic or platonic, it doesn't necessarily mean you'll abstain from all future relationships.  Time makes a fool of us all and we eventually forget the pain we endured and we allow ourselves to once again be vulnerable.  But history repeats itself for people who don't learn, and that's a golden rule.  So I'd like to now change this idiom to fit my own experience: "twice bitten, incoming third."
