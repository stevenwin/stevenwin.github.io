title: 11 22 63 - Review
---

Stephen King is one of my all time favourite author.  His writing style is concise yet he's able to portray vivid imagery and invoke complex emotions.  The thing I love most about his books, though, is that he never fails to give me physical chills through his words.

11-22-63 is no different.

Stephen King is known for stories that are filled with ghosts, monsters and crazy people, and even though this novel isn't something as expected (ok, there are a few), he still manages to instill that constant feeling of dread and fear in every chapter.

The gist of the book is about one man's journey into the past to try and stop the assisination of JFK.  Why JFK specifically?  I'm not American so my knowledge of presidential history is quite shits but I presume he was one of the better presidents and his assasination was a major blow to the US.  Thankfully, it didn't really matter that I didn't know much about JFK while I was reading the book.  King never made any assumptions that we should know who he is or really care.  The true enjoyment of the book comes from the front row view of the adventures, triumphs and failures experienced by our leading man, George Amberson (Jake Eppings).

It's a thick book and King takes his time to make you really care about the protagonist and all of his relationships and run-ins.  I often found myself feeling sorry for the characters that were meant to be portrayed as evil because King always alluded to a reason behind the madness.  He humanized Lee Harvey Oswald and gave us reasons to sympathize.

11-22-63 is an extremely fun read, especially if you enjoy movies like Back to the Future and Terminator.  The book is thick and I'm thankful it is because while I was reading, I was hoping it wouldn't end.  When our hero triumphed, I was felt physically elated and when he failed, I was cursing his adversities.  However, it's not without its flaws as with all stories dealing with Time Travel face, but notwithstanding those issues, I highly recommend the book.

**9/10**
