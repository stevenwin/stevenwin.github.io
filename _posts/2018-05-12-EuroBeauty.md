title: European Beauty

As I stepped off the plane onto this new continent, it was immediately apparent that there is something special about this part of the world.  I always hear about the beauty of Europe, but I'm now seeing it first hand and it's undeniable.

The buildings are megalithic and rich in history.  Some buildings have weathered centuries, even millenia, and you can spend hours admiring the intricate architecture.  There's an identity to each region.  Coming from a country that's barely over 150 years, it's a unique perspective to see how these people are brought into being by their environment.

I'm excited for the days to come and I have a feeling my stories will quickly accumulate here.
