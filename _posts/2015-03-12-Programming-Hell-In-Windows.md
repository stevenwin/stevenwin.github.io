title: Progamming Hell in Windows
---

I've always wondered why the entire Silicon Valley demographic seemed to consist solely of Apple laptops.  I grew up on Windows and my only exposure to Apple machines happened in 1999 when I was using my friend's dad's Macintosh to play games.  The interface was very different from Windows, and being a kid with fondness for familiarity, I hated it.  On top of it all, there were very few mainstream games running on Macs as well.

One bad experience as an impressionable kid and I wrote off Apple for the next 16 years.

Lately, as I'm beginning my journey into web development, I've noticed that the majority of tutorial websites use Apple.  Sure, there are many websites featuring tutorials on Windows, but they seem more like an afterthought sort of appeasement than an actual preference.

More fanboy-ism I thought.

Then I started running through [TheOdinProject](theodinproject.com).  Believe me when I say that I finally understand why Apple is the machine of choice when it comes to web development.  I read this before somewhere and it didn't click then but Apple "is just easier."

Before I could start any of the projects for Ruby on Rails, I had to install a bunch of things.  Even before installing RoR itself, I had to install MySQL, which immediately broke.  I googled the hell of the issue to troubleshoot and after a good couple of hours, I finally managed a bandage fix before removing certain files and replacing/installing others.  It was messy but it worked; it was also short-lived.  Installing RoR was fine but then I got to another section to install gems and that BROKE.

And you know what's really annoying?  I bought a fucken Microsoft Surface so I could learn web development.  

Oh well, whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger right?  SHITBUTT!
