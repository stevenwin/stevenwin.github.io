**DRAFT**

The Blog layout I'm using is from a Jekyll Theme called Brume.  I really like it.  It's simple enough that it gives succinct information in a pleasant way.  I want to use it longer but I think a better way, value-wise, is to build my own.  That way, I can learn about the Jekyll framework and Liquid templating language.
