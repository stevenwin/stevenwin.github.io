We all make the mistake in assuming that we're finished products in terms of knowledge and skill.  A thirty-year-old will look back on their twenties and wonder how they were so naive.  Likewise, individuals many years older will look back a decade prior and wonder the same.  We never stop growing and we never stop changing but we like to assume, since there's no time like the present, that our future selves will be more or less the same.

I'm entering my thirties in a couple of weeks and looking back, it's almost as if I've changed completely in terms of my interests, outlook and temperment.  I was a cocky kid in my early twenties, thinking I had the world figured out.  I understood that my place was not in academics and I was to fast track my education just enough to get a decent job that would provide me enough income to live comfortably with the least amount of effort.  I reached my mediocrity goals and I was content.. for a little while.  Sure enough, the void of having no goals eventually showed itself and I went through many years aimlessly trying to find my place in this world.

Now, almost a decade later, I'm much more humble about my outlook on life.  I now understand that goals aren't meant to be reached.  Goals are supposed to be lofty yet realistic.  They're meant to be just out of reach where it can be used as a benchmark for your current self.

## My short term goals:

- Finish my web scraping project

- Finish my itinerary for my Vietnam backpacking trip in a couple of months
- Enrol in Jiu Jitsu

## My long term goals:

- Become a competent web developer or data analyzer
- Become a Jiu Jitsu black belt
