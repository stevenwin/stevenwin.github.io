title: Alternative Realities

As I make my way from the honeymoon capital of Da Lat into the mountainous region of the Central Highlands, it became apparent that much of the country is still stuck in a time warp.  Skidding through the dilapidated roads, from the vantage of my Nouvo, I watched as men and boys shovel dirt onto the back of trucks while the sun beamed down.  A short distance away, a pack of children no older than five are running along the fields giggling among themselves, enjoying the freedom of innocence and youth.

I drift away for a moment, imagining an alternate reality where my family never left.  I pass a corner and see the laughing children in my rear mirror, still running, disappearing into their own thread of existence.
