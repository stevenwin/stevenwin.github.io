title: Ethereum's Road Map For 2017
---

At a recent blockchain-focused conference, software developer and member of the Ethereum Foundation, Hudson Jameson, gave a presentation in which he discussed Ethereum's roadmap and the future of the blockchain ecosystem. Jameson started the presentation by going over the history of Ethereum, beginning with the formal announcement made by Ethereum brainchild, Vitalik Buterin, at the North American Bitcoin Conference in January 2015. 

Light-clients, such as Status, a mobile Ethereum Dapp that will soon be available for iPhone and Android, are advancing consumer adoption by allowing users to access the usage data they need without downloading the entire Ethereum blockchain. Current Ethereum users must download the Ethereum client that contains the blockchain, logic layer, storage layer, and consensus layer, which are all packaged together. 

According to Jameson, "Ethereum abstraction is the ability to swap out consensus protocols within Ethereum - the ability to have different types of account security." With the release of Serenity, Ethereum abstraction will offer developers more flexibility, such as the use of UTXO tree token management on the Ethereum blockchain. 

The final section of the presentation, "What Makes Ethereum Different?" discussed the benefits and unique qualities of Ethereum that have spurred much of the innovation within the blockchain space.
