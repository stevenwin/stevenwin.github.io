title: Jetlagged Brain

Having stayed in Asia for the past 3 months, my circadian system has fully adjusted.  I arrived in Vancouver yesterday and I'm having a hard time adjusting.  I'm sleeping at odd hours and it's only in intermittent cycles.  I'm irritated with brain fog.  I don't think I've ever stayed in another time zone long enough to be this messed up.

Damn you, jetlag!
