title: You Never Step in the Same River Twice

Over the past few years I've noticed changes in myself.  It all happened gradually until one day I realized the things I used to be engrossed in, I no longer have an interest in.  It's funny how that works.

I used to be an avid gamer.  The peak of that experience was during my high school days when I would spend countless hours a week on video games.  Somehow, I still managed to get my school work and social life in as well but thinking back, it really was an ungodly amount of time wasted.  On one specific game, Continuum, I think I logged something like 4200 hours -- that's 175 full days and close to that 10,000 hours of mastery that's always cited.  Madness.

These days, I can't play any game for longer than 15 or so minutes.  I've just outgrown video games.  The same goes for a bunch of my other interest.  I've also gotten closer to nature.  I enjoy the outdoors a hell of lot more than I did even just 2 years ago.  I can spend my time out there wandering, thinking and just doing nothing.

Hmm.. I'm almost one of those old people.
