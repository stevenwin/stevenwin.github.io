There once was a cat named Jane,  
She loved to fly in planes.

My name is Steven and this is a personal blog to document my trials and tribulations.  Writing is important because our memories are fickle, and without proper documentation, we‘ll eventually wake up 10 years down the road asking where did the time go? (I've been doing that)

I‘m still trying to figure out my place in this world and each year that passes, I feel I‘m a little bit closer to the answer.  Of course nobody is ever completely done their transformation but with an honest focus, self-actualization is definitely within reach for all of us.
